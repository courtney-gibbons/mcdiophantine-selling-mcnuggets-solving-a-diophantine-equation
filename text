6a + 9b + 20c = 50
a = 5, b = 0, c = 1

6a + 9b + 20c = 51
a = 1, b = 5, c = 0

6a + 9b + 20c = 52
a = 2, b = 0, c = 2

6a + 9b + 20c = 53
a = 1, b = 3, c = 1

6a + 9b + 20c = 54
a = 9, b = 0, c = 0

6a + 9b + 20c = 55
a = 1, b = 1, c = 2

Theorem: If it is possible to buy x, x + 1,â€¦, x + 5 sets of McNuggets, for some x, then it is
possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20
packs.

This theorem is true because if you can buy x nuggets, you can buy x + 6 nuggets by adding another 6-pack.  Similarly, if you can buy x + 1 nuggets, you can buy x + 7 nuggets by adding another 6-pack, and so on.
